# weather-app-team-project

Creating a weather app with fetched data from Weather API. A team project. Mady by enikobuza, KacagoHollo, klikknpro, pexyke, Skoda130rs.

In the HTML file there are only a div tag with root id without children when the page load in.

User can choose every capital city from a dropdown list, and the app shows different details (e.g. date, fahrenheit, humidity, celsius) of the chosen city. 
There are attached unique pictures to the most citys, and they are changing randomly in the background.
